Spatial Autocorrelation &amp; Modelling the relationship of drug abuse with drug abuse related crime
This work begins by testing the correlation of drugs abuse with drug abuse related crimes and shows that there is a correlation between the two as places with high drug abuse tend to have high drug abuse related crimes. A Moran's I was used to test the correlation. Thereafter, a Linear Model was produced to test the relationship which displayed an increasing trend showing that there was a strong relationship between the variables being modelled
